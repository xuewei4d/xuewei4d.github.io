The week 5 began with a discussion with whether we should deprecate ```params```. 
I fixed some bugs in checking functions, random number generator and one of covariance updating methods. 
In the following days, I completed the main functions of ```GaussianMixutre``` and all test cases, except 
AIC, BIC and sampling functions. The tests are some kind of challenging, sine the current implementation
in the master branch contains very old test cases imported from Weiss's implementation which is never 
got improved. I simplified the test cases, and wrote more tests that are not covered by the current implementation,
such as covariance estimation, ground truth parameter prediction, and other user-friendly warnings and errors.

Next week, I will begin to code ```BayesianGaussianMixture```.
