My mentor gave me some useful advices after I finished all the codes of ```BayesianGaussianMixture``` and ```DirichletProcessGaussianMixture```.  So in these two weeks, I fixed the style problems and did all the necessary test cases for 
```BayesianGaussianMixture```.  I also did the visualization of Gaussian mixture with variational inference for four types of precision using ```matplotlib.animation```, [link](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4802#issuecomment-126805499)

Next step, I will explore some optional tasks which are incremental learning and other covariance estimators besides the test cases of ```DirichletProcessGaussianMixture```.
